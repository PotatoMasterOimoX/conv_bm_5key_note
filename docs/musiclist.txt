------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II. BEATMANIA BASICS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a. The Groove Gauge
-------------------

Accurate keypresses or scratches increase your "groove gauge". To clear
a song and be able to move on, you have to get it over 80%. In this game,
there isn't a percentage attached to the gauge, so you need to get it in
the red. If your gauge drops to 0% in Kobako or Shikomi modes, you don't
fail out immediately, and you can still bring the gauge back into the 
red and pass the song. If your gauge drops to 0% in Tsunagi mode, you
fail out immediately and the game ends.

Different accuracies increase or decrease your groove gauge at different
rates. Flashing Greats, Greats, and Goods increase your gauge; Bads and 
Poors decrease it.


b. Failing a Song
-----------------

If you fail a song in Kobako or Shikomi modes, you get a chance to
continue. If you don't continue, the game is over. Continuing utterly 
destroys your overall grade unless you failed your first song, so it's 
better to let the game end and start a new one. If you fail on Tsunagi 
mode, the game simply ends. If you fail on Sozai Mode, nothing happens 
unless it was the final song, in which case the game ends.


c. Clearing a Song
------------------

If you reach the end of the song and your gauge is in the red, you have
cleared the song. You'll then be judged on your accuracy and given a score.
This score is not what is used to determine your grade - your EX Score is.
Your EX Score is based on the number of Flashing Greats and Greats you get.
The highest possible EX score on a song is the number of notes times two.

Flashing Great: 2 points
Great: 1 point
Good, Bad, Poor: 0 points

The grading system is as follows:

A - Greater than 8/9 of highest possible EX score
B - Greater than 7/9 and less than 8/9 of highest possible EX score
C - Greater than 6/9 and less than 7/9 of highest possible EX score
D - Greater than 5/9 and less than 6/9 of highest possible EX score
E - Greater than 4/9 and less than 5/9 of highest possible EX score
F - Greater than 3/9 and less than 4/9 of highest possible EX score
G - Greater than 2/9 and less than 3/9 of highest possible EX score
H - Less than 2/9 of highest possible EX score. You practically have to
	just sit there and do nothing to earn an H.

These are inclusive - that is, if you get exactly 7/9 of the highest
possible EX score, you will get a B.

This is a modified version of the EX score system in the Beatmania IIDX
series - there are no AAAs or AAs. You receive grades after each song
and at the end of the game, whenever the game ends (Game Over or after
your set of songs).

For your main score (also known as the "money score"), you can earn
several bonuses depending on how you did:

Border Bonus: 5730 points. You get this bonus if you finished the song
	with your groove gauge at 80% (or just into the red). 

Perfect Bonus: 1910 points.. Awarded if you get all Greats and Flashing 
	Greats on a song. Poors	resulting from extra note hits don't 
	count.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
III. GAME MODES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beatmania III the Final has three main game modes, and an unlockable fourth
(see section 8.a. - "Sozai Mode"). They correspond with the basic game
modes in the earlier Beatmania games. Once you choose a mode, you are
locked into it and cannot access any other modes.


a. Kobako Mode
--------------

This mode has easier notecharts than Shikomi and Tsunagi Modes. You cannot 
access Anothers in Kobako mode. Kobako Mode also uses the grading system 
from early Beatmania games that did not have Flashing Greats - your score 
and grade are based on the total number of Greats (flashing or not) you 
get.


b. Shikomi Mode
---------------

This is the regular game mode of Beatmania III the Final, and you can play 
Anothers and Foot Mode charts in this mode. Shikomi mode uses the regular 
grading system, as described in Section 2. You cannot access the Kobako mode 
charts in this mode.


c. Tsunagi Mode
---------------

In this mode, you make a nonstop course by choosing any four songs to play. 
You can play Anothers and Foot Mode, but you cannot choose Kobako mode charts,
and you can't play any song more than once.

Tsunagi has a special groove gauge that does not recharge and is always red. To
pass, you simply need to have something left on the groove gauge at the end of
the course. There are no Border/Perfect/Whatever bonuses in this mode. The
gauge does not recharge, and when it hits 0, you are failed out and the game 
ends.

NOTE:

In Kobako and Shikomi modes, you can't choose from all the songs right off the
bat. For your first stage, you get to choose from about a third of the songs.
When you clear that, another third of the songs is added. For the final stage,
the rest of the songs are added, but a few of the easier ones are removed.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IV. FLOPPY DISK PLAY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beatmania III machines are unique in that they have floppy disk drives
built into them. Now, you're probably wondering "what the heck is that
good for"? I'm here to tell you.

In the Beatmania III series, you can use a floppy disk to save your scores
in all three main game modes. After your game ends but before your final
DJ Level screen, a chart appears with your highest scores on every song 
in the mode you played, including all Anothers and Foot Mode charts.

A floppy disk is also required to unlock Sozai Mode (see section 8.a. -
"Sozai Mode".

Note that if you use a floppy disk in an earlier version of Beatmania III
(Beatmania III, Beatmania III Append 6th Mix, Beatmania III Append 7th Mix,
Beatmania III Append CORE REMIX), your scores for those games won't be
overwritten if they're higher than the scores you get in Beatmania III the
Final.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. MODIFIERS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first thing you'll see when you put tokens into the machine is a screen
with two keypad diagrams on it, featuring certain modifiers that correspond to
each key. To activate these modifiers, you have to hit the key. If more than
one modifier corresponds to the key, and you want the second one in the list,
simply hit the key twice. There are a few modifiers that can't be chosen on
this screen - to choose these, hit the Start button on the music select menu.
Also, there are some that you're locked into for the duration of the game,
such as Double.


a. Hi-Speed
-----------

Hi-Speed is the most useful modifier in the game. Hi-Speed increases the rate
at which the notes scroll down the screen, making the notes easier to read.
Depending on how many times you hit the key to turn this mode on, you can
choose from x1, x1.5, x2, x2.5, x3, x4, x6, x8, and x16. 

If you can read the notes on x16, you are obviously a person with superhuman 
powers or something. It's practically identical to Stealth.


b. Hidden/Sudden/Stealth
------------------------

These mods are used if you want to give yourself even more of a challenge. 
Hidden causes the notes to disappear before they reach the bottom of the
screen. Sudden makes the notes appear near the bottom of the screen. 

Stealth hides the notes entirely - if you can play a hard song on Stealth, 
go sit over there with the person who plays on x16 and wait for a superhero 
comic to be written about you, because you truly are special.

Note that Hidden and Sudden can be used at the same time. Unlike previous
games and IIDX games, though, Hidden and Sudden used together equal Stealth
in this game. There really is no difference, and any high scores will be
marked with "Stealth" if you use Hidden and Sudden together.


c. Battle/Center
----------------

Battle is a mod that allows you to have "DJ battles" of sorts. Instead of 
dividing the 1P chart between both sides, both players get the same (1P) chart.
Highest score on each song wins the song, most songs won wins the game.

Center is an extremely useful mod. It locks the second player out of the game,
and lets one player use the 1P turntable and the 2P set of keys. It's extremely
useful if you're used to the Beatmania IIDX controller for PS2, which has a
similar layout by default.

Once you choose Battle or Center, you're locked into it for the whole game.
Obviously, you cannot choose both Battle and Center.


d. Double
---------

Double is a game mode that requires you to use all 10 keys and both turntables
to play songs. It takes a lot of talent to do this on a Beatmania III the Final
machine, but it can be done. The charts are entirely different from a normal
2-player game. There are even some songs that are only available on Double,
but there are also some songs that are only available in 1P or Battle modes,
so keep that in mind.

Once you choose Double, you're locked into it for the duration of the game.

Note that you don't have to choose Double in order to play on both sides at
once. However, the game will think you are playing a 2P game without Battle,
and you'll just get 1P charts divided between both sides. You also won't be
able to select songs available only on Double mode.


e. Random/Mirror
----------------

Random randomly randomizes the notecharts for each song. The notecharts you 
get on Random are usually different each time, and the song may become
easier or harder. Use Random at your own risk.

Mirror does what its name implies - it makes the notechart a mirror image of
its former self. For example, if a song contains a chord using keys 1 and 3,
the Mirror version's chord will use keys 3 and 5.

Random and Mirror cannot be used together in this game.


f. Transparent
--------------

All Transparent does is make the surface on which the notes scroll down
transparent (you can see through it). This mod is on by default, but you can
turn it off if the background animations prove to be distracting. Turning
off Transparent is highly recommended.


g. Fast Play
------------

You can only adjust this mod on the song select menu (press Start on the
song select menu). 

Fast Play IS NOT Hi-Speed. Fast Play actually increases or decreases the
speed of the song by different increments, making the song easier or harder.
If you use this mod with the Hi-Speed mod, make sure you don't have Hi-Speed
set too high, or else you won't be able to read the notes.

Here is what each Fast/Slow Play mode does:

Fast 1: 1.25x faster
Fast 2: 1.6x faster
Fast 3: 2x faster
Slow: 0.8x normal speed

Note that you can't do this to every song - only about half the songs let
you change their speeds.


h. Separate
-----------

If you started off playing Beatmania IIDX, this is an important mod to use. 
Separate causes the lines on the notechart to be separate, instead of 
overlapping like they usually do. This makes chords easier to read, but may
interfere with your timing if you're used to playing the original way.

You can only choose Separate on the song select menu. It's off by default. 
In modes other than Center, there will be options for different frame styles -
just scroll through these until you find Separate. The other frames are just
there to look good and have no effect on gameplay.

There is also a version of Separate that comes complete with a chart that 
tracks how many Flashing Greats, Greats, Goods, Bads, and Poors you have as
you play the song. This isn't very useful, but it does disable the background
videos if you find them distracting. You can also use this feature in regular
play (that is, without Separate).


i. Foot Play
------------

For starters, Foot Play is NOT Foot Mode! Foot Mode is a difficulty, like
Another. Foot Play is a modifier.

Foot Play allows you to press the foot pedal instead of a specified note. You
can have the foot pedal replace any of the five keys, but not the turntable.
If you use this modifier, keep in mind that the key you're substituting the
pedal for will be disabled for the duration of the song - hitting the key
won't give you credit for the note.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. SONG LIST
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section provides notecounts and BPMs for all the songs. Due to the sheer
difficulty of noting down all the difficulties in approximately 60 seconds,
none are listed.

To access the Another or Foot difficulties, press both black keys on the
song select screen.

*Note: Not all songs have Anothers. Songs without Anothers simply won't have
	any Another notecounts. The same goes for Foot Mode.

8. SECRETS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a. Sozai Mode
-------------

In Sozai Mode, you get three stages. You cannot choose Kobako Mode charts,
BUT you can choose from all the songs for your first and second stages.
Also, you can do something you can't do in regular play - you can play
the same song more than once. You could play the same song three times if
you wanted to. Basically, this mode lets you try to improve your scores on 
Shikomi Mode without the danger of failing out and losing the game.

You have to play with a floppy disk to unlock Sozai Mode, and you have to
pass certain songs to do it. Here's the list of songs you need to clear to 
unlock Sozai Mode. What grade or score you get on each one does not matter, 
you just have to clear them on Kobako or Shikomi modes - not Tsunagi.

FROM BEATMANIA COMPLETE MIX:

Quick Master


FROM BEATMANIA COMPLETE MIX 2:

Prince On a Star
PARANOiA MAX (Dirty Mix)
22DUNK
R3
Keep On Movin'


FROM BEATMANIA COMPLETE MIX 2 ANOTHERS:

*Note: You must do these on Shikomi mode, since they're not available in
Kobako mode.

Luv To Me (Disco Mix) another
Boa Boa Lady another


FROM BEATMANIA CORE REMIX:

R5
era (nostalmix)
Reincarnation


FROM BEATMANIA 7th MIX:

Afronova Primeval


FROM BEATMANIA THE FINAL:

Kiss Kiss Kiss
Quickening
Jet World
VOIDDD
Dance the Night Away
West Shinjuku Cleaning Tune
Candy (Star)
Dr.LOVE
Special Energy
Cloudy Music (unlockable)
Baila! Baila!
Happy Man
Implantation (unlockable)
Gamelan de Couple
la brise d'ete
Daikenkai
Brilliant 2U
Gentle Stress
Gambol

Yes, you must play VOIDDD and Gambol, the loudest songs in the game. I
don't know why. Also, in order to play Sozai Mode each time you play the
game, you must use your floppy disk with scores from all the songs listed
above. It is not permanently unlocked on the machine for all to play.
Also, YOU MUST UNLOCK THE HIDDEN SONGS IF YOU WANT TO GET SOZAI MODE!


b. Unlocking Songs
------------------

Songs cannot be unlocked by just playing over and over. There are only a
few unlockable songs, and you'll have to have your arcade manager or
whoever maintains the machine input a code to unlock the songs. You'll
know the songs are available if you see a little alien icon on the lower
left-hand side of the title screen.

*NOTE: IF YOU WANT SOZAI MODE, YOU NEED TO UNLOCK THE SONGS FIRST!*

Here's the code:

In Test Mode, go to the Color Check screen. Hold down the 2P Start button,
and press keys 2, 2, 1, 10, 9, 3, 1, 4, 1, and 6. Exit Color Check - if
you see an asterisk, you've entered the code correctly.

By the way, the keys are numbered from left to right (O represents the
turntable):

-----------------
 2 4      7 9
1 3 5 O  6 8 10 O
-----------------

And here's what songs you get:

Miracle Moon
The Least 100sec
Cloudy Music
Retrofuture
COREDESAT
Implantation


c. Ending Themes
----------------

Depending on what game the last song you play is from, you'll get a
different ending theme and credits video when you complete your set of
songs. Here's the list:

Beatmania the Final: One Seek

Beatmania 7th Mix: Lying on the Bench (if your last song was from
	6th Mix) or Monotone (if it was from 7th Mix)

Beatmania CORE REMIX: Beatmania CORE REMIX ending theme

Beatmania III: Mnemoniq

Beatmania Complete Mix: Love's Theme of Beatmania

Beatmania Complete MIX 2: Beatmania 4th Mix Ending (if your last song
	was from 4th Mix, 5th Mix, or CM2) or Retrofuture (Club Mix).

It is also possible to get La Bossanova de Fabienne as your ending song.
This is rare, though, and only playing Ain't It Good, Body, and La 
Bossanova de Fabienne seem to trigger it.

You will get One Seek more often than not on Tsunagi mode regardless of
the songs you play.

The only ending you get in Sozai Mode is the Game Over screen.
